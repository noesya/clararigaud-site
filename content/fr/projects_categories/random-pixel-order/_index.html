        <p>I co-founded Random Pixel Order in 2015 with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaycartis/" target="_blank">Jay Cartis<span class="sr-only"> - lien externe</span></a> when I was an undergraduate in Bordeaux. The aim of the collective was to bring together the DIY worlds of fanzines and computer science and understand how they could mutually cross-pollinate. We wanted to promote the work of digital artists exploring experimental techniques of visual creation by offering them a tangible space for distribution away from the screen: print. We also wanted to encourage encounters between artists from the DIY and craft worlds of experimental digital creation and micro-publishing. This is how, from 2015 to 2019, we published several editions of fanzines and prints, and took part in various exhibitions, while experimenting with digital and interactive creations. We also developed two major projects with the collective: Screenshot and The Archive.</p>
