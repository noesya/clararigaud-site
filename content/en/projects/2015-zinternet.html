        <p>For my studies, I had to make a website, and I don't like things that do nothing but get a grade. I therefore proposed <a href="http://www.disparate.fr/" target="_blank">Disparate<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, which organizes this micro-edition festival, to make the website of the festival free of charge.</p><p>The idea behind Zinternet is a white page on which all visitors to the site can draw. The drawings produced by visitors are also posted on the <a href="https://zinternet.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> of the project. These drawings are then published as a fanzine available at free price in support of the Zinefest festival.</p><p>Today, he continues to accompany the Zinefest festival year after year, welcoming drawings for each new edition.</p>
